## What is NorthstarDB?

NorthstarDB is a database built from scratch in Zig, designed for:

- **Massive read concurrency** - Many readers, single writer architecture
- **Deterministic replay** - Crash safety through commit stream logging
- **AI-driven intelligence** - Autonomous maintenance and optimization
- **Explicit performance** - No hidden allocations, no hidden errors

## Key Features

### Core Architecture
- **Single file format** with pager system for efficient storage
- **B+tree** ordered key-value store
- **MVCC snapshots** for concurrent reads
- **Commit stream** for crash recovery and time-travel queries

### AI Intelligence (Phase 7)
- **Plugin system** for LLM function calling
- **Structured memory cartridges** (entities, topics, relationships)
- **Natural language query** planning and optimization
- **Autonomous optimization** - the database understands itself

## Design Philosophy

> **Benchmarks and tests are the source of truth**

NorthstarDB follows strict principles:

1. **Explicit memory** - No hidden allocations
2. **Explicit errors** - All error paths visible
3. **Explicit performance** - Measured through reproducible benchmarks
4. **State is derived** - The commit log is the source of truth
5. **Pay coordination at commit** - Not on every read

## Target Workload

Designed for **orchestrated AI coding agents** with:
- Massive concurrent access patterns
- Semantic understanding of data
- Natural language query interfaces
- Autonomous optimization requirements

## Project Status

Currently in Phase 0: Core database implementation with comprehensive benchmarks and hardening tests.

See [PLAN-LIVING-DB.md](https://github.com/nikopol/northstardb/blob/main/PLAN-LIVING-DB.md) for the complete roadmap.

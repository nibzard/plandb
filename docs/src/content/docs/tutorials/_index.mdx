import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Learn NorthstarDB through hands-on interactive tutorials. Each tutorial includes live code execution using WebAssembly — no installation required.

## Get Started

<details>
  <summary>How to use these tutorials</summary>

  Each tutorial features an interactive code runner that:
  - Runs real NorthstarDB code in your browser
  - Lets you modify and experiment with examples
  - Shows output instantly without any setup

  Just click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter) to execute the code.

## By Difficulty

### Beginner
- **Task Queue in 15 Minutes** — Learn core database operations through a practical example
- **Quick Start** — [Setup guide](/guides/quick-start/) with basic CRUD operations

### Intermediate
- **Semantic Search** — Entity extraction and topic indexing
- **Time Travel Queries** — MVCC snapshots and historical querying
- **Document Repository** — Full-text search and metadata indexing

### Advanced
- **AI Plugin Development** — Extensible intelligence architecture
- **Performance Optimization** — Benchmarking and profiling techniques
- **Cartridge Development** — Structured memory for AI workloads

## Tutorial Features

Each interactive tutorial includes:

- **Live Code Execution** — Run code directly in your browser
- **Step-by-Step Guidance** — Clear explanations at each step
- **Real-World Examples** — Practical patterns you can use
- **Challenge Exercises** — Test your understanding
- **Extension Ideas** — Ways to build on what you learn

## Prerequisites

While some tutorials are beginner-friendly, having basic knowledge of the following will help:

- **Programming fundamentals** — variables, functions, loops
- **Basic database concepts** — keys, values, transactions (helpful but not required)
- **Command line basics** — running commands from a terminal

For local development with NorthstarDB:
- **Zig 0.13.0+** — Download from [ziglang.org](https://ziglang.org/download/)
- **Git** — For cloning the repository

## Learning Path

We recommend this progression:

1. **Quick Start** — [Get up and running](/guides/quick-start/)
2. **Task Queue Tutorial** — Build your first complete application
3. **Time Travel Queries** — Understand MVCC and snapshots
4. **Semantic Search** — Explore AI intelligence features
5. **AI Plugin Development** — Extend the database with custom logic

## What You'll Build

Across these tutorials, you'll build:

- **Task Queue System** — Concurrent job processing with atomic claims
- **Knowledge Base** — Semantic search with entity relationships
- **Audit Trail** — Historical data queries for compliance
- **AI Plugin** — Custom intelligence using LLM function calling

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>Code runner not loading</summary>

  - Check your browser console for errors
  - Ensure JavaScript is enabled
  - Try refreshing the page
  - Some corporate networks may block WASM modules
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Code runs but produces errors</summary>

  - Check syntax in the code editor
  - Each line executes sequentially — ensure dependencies are met
  - The tutorial examples are tested and should work as-is
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Want to run locally?</summary>

  Clone NorthstarDB and run the examples:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nikopol/northstardb.git
  cd northstardb/examples/task_queue
  zig build run
  ```

  See [Installation Guide](/guides/installation/) for details.

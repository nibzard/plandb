## What is NorthstarDB?

NorthstarDB is a database built from scratch in **Zig** — designed as a step-by-step educational project that evolves into a production-ready **"Living Database"** with AI-driven intelligence.

Built for the era of orchestrated AI coding agents, NorthstarDB provides:

- **Massive read concurrency** — MVCC snapshots for 100s of parallel agents
- **Deterministic replay** — Commit stream as an audit log
- **Time travel queries** — Query historical snapshots cheaply
- **AI Intelligence** — Structured memory cartridges, natural language queries, autonomous optimization
- **Cartridges** — Offline-built, hot-path artifacts for fast graph/vector queries

## Core Concepts

### The Commit Stream
Every transaction emits a canonical commit record. This is the source of truth — the log from which all state is derived.

### MVCC Snapshots
Many readers, single writer. Snapshot reads are always cheap — coordination is paid at commit, not on every read.

### Structured Memory Cartridges 🆕
AI-extracted entities, topics, and relationships stored as query-optimizable indices. Function calling over embeddings.

### Autonomous Intelligence 🆕
The database maintains and optimizes itself based on usage patterns — understanding its own data.

## Why NorthstarDB?

Modern AI coding systems are moving from "one assistant in one editor" to **orchestrated swarms**:

- 100s of parallel tasks (analysis, refactor, test gen, security scans)
- Long-running sessions (hours/days)
- Distributed workers (cloud + local, multiple devs)
- Huge working sets (whole repos, dependency graphs, traces, embeddings)
- Need for replayable decisions ("why did agent X do this?")

Existing databases each miss important pieces. NorthstarDB unifies the essential primitives in one coherent system.

## Project Principles

1. **Benchmarks are law** — Performance changes only count if the benchmark suite agrees
2. **Correctness first** — Property tests + crash tests run from day one
3. **State is derived; the log is truth** — Data structures are rebuildable from the commit stream
4. **Pay coordination at commit** — Snapshot reads are always cheap
5. **Make performance visible** — Every subsystem ships with counters and microbenchmarks
6. **Predictable > clever** — Tail latency matters more than peak throughput
7. **No hidden costs** — Track allocations/op and bytes moved in all hot paths

This license is specifically designed to protect the AI intelligence innovations
and competitive advantages of NorthstarDB while allowing for legitimate educational,
research, and non-AI commercial uses. The restrictions are narrowly tailored to
prevent the Software from being used to train competing AI database systems
or AI services that could diminish the unique value proposition of NorthstarDB's
Living Database architecture.
